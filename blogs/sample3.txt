End of August , it has been a long month. There is still uncertainity in my mind , no posiitive aspects
to help me stay motivated and yet it's not the worst I have nothing to complain about , I just hope
that this time will pass too and the better days will come and for that to happen i need to be sincere
about life. The crossroads I find myself is very intricate and I must take a decision to my truest.
